Depending on the ChIP-seq data repository (e.g., ChIP-atlas or ENCODE) the pipeline may slightly vary. For this reason there is a folder for each repository with its respective Snakefile and Config file.

This folder is divided in 2 subfolders:

- bin       : with all the executable files called in the workflow.
- CHIP-atlas: contains all the analysis performed in ChIP-atlas datasets + Snakefile + Config file


## Download ChIP-seq datasets from ChIP-atlas


- Change the directory:
` cd motif_discovery_pipeline/ChIP-atlas `


- Launch the script. You must specify the directory ( current directory '.' in this example) and the genome version (ce10, C elegans). This program will first download the experiment table from ChIP-atlas and then all the experiments (narrowpeak format) for the given genome.
`
Rscript bin/ChIP_atlas_download_TF_peaks_by_genome.R . ce10
